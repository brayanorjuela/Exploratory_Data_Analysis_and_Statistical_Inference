# Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistical Inference

Project from DataCamp in which the skills needed to perform a visual and quantitative exploration analysis to then use statistical inference are put to the test.

The main goal of this project is to ensure the ability to conduct a visual and quantitative exploratory data analysis upon which a value of interest is statistically inferred. This is done initially through the selection and cleaning of relevant data, followed by the visualization of variables of interest and its relations with other variables and themselves. Moreover, based on this exploratory data analysis, the resampling method called Bootstraping is used to find the true confidence interval of the value of interest. The evaluation regarding the ability to conduct such analysis takes place through the completion of a series of tasks presented in the jupyter notebook in this repository.

**The project tasks were developed by the platform DataCamp and they were completed by Brayan Orjuela**
